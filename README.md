## About the project
The aim of this project is to model the management of a computational network that contains several clusters with different parameters, receiving a submission of computation requests (jobs), and optimize its functioning according to a criterion of minimization of the computation time or of the energy consumption.

## How to use the project
The distribution of files is as follows:
 * <ins>Arch_grid.py:</ins> contains the implementation of the model presented in the report
 * <ins>Main.py:</ins> main file initializing parameters, creating objects and performing the simulations with output display
